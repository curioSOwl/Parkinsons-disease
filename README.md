# Parkinson's Disease Detection using Voice and Spiral Handwriting

This project focuses on detecting Parkinson's disease using voice and spiral handwriting data. It combines a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for voice-based detection and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for spiral handwritten image-based detection. The models are then fused using the late fusion technique, with a Logistic Regression model to provide the final output.

## Installation

Install the required dependencies:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare the input data:
- Record the audio of the patient using the provided voice recording functionality.
- Capture the image of the spiral handwriting using the integrated image capture feature.

2. Run the inference:
- Provide the recorded audio and captured image as input to the pre-trained models.
- The SVM model analyzes the voice data to detect Parkinson's disease.
- The CNN model processes the spiral handwriting image for Parkinson's detection.
- Apply the late fusion technique to combine the outputs of the SVM and CNN models.
- Use the Logistic Regression model to generate the final output.

## Configuration

- No additional configuration is required for the pre-trained models.
- Adjust the threshold or decision criteria in the code based on the project's specific requirements.
